# Parking Lot System
This project implements a parking lot system with dummy database functionality using Java. It is designed to demonstrate various software design principles, patterns, and standards.

## Overview
The parking lot system supports the management of multiple parking lots, each containing parking floors and parking slots. Each parking slot can accommodate specific types of vehicles based on their size and type.

## Features

* **Multiple Parking Lots:** The system can manage multiple parking lots, each with its own set of parking floors.
* **Parking Floors:** Each parking lot consists of multiple parking floors, accommodating different numbers of vehicles.
* **Parking Slots:** The system supports various vehicles, including cars, motorcycles, trucks, buses, and bicycles.
* **Dummy Database:** Although the system does not use a real database, it simulates database functionality using a map-based data structure.

## Usage
To use the parking lot system, follow these steps:

* **Compile the Code:** Compile the Java source files using a Java compiler.
* **Run the Application:** Execute the main application class "Client.java" to start the parking lot system. This class serves as the entry point to our system, allowing you to interact with its functionality seamlessly.
* **Customization Options:** Feel free to explore the codebase and customize the system to suit your needs. Want to change the database implementation, tweak the parking allocation strategy, or bill amount calculation strategy? The flexibility of design allows you to do just with ease.
